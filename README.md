# Expression_trees_using_BST
TITLE: EXPRESSION TREES USING BST
DESCRIPTION: IMPLEMENT THE EXPRESSION TREES USING BST.
1.  CREATION
2.  DERIVE INFIX EXPRESSION.
3.  DERIVE PREFIX EXPRESSION.
4.  DERIVE POSTFIX EXPRESSION.
Advantages: -
•	Postfix expression is simple to execute as a comparison to the infix expression it required more operation to execute.
•	In the postfix expression the overhead of brackets is not there while in the infix expression the overhead of brackets is there.
•	The precedence of the operator has not affected the postfix expression while in the infix operator precedence is important.
•	In the prefix version you do not have to ever think about the precedence of operators.
•	Because each expression has the operator before all the operands and the entire expression is wrapped in parentheses, all precedence is explicit.
•	If we plan to use the same operator on many operands, we do not have to repeat the operator between them.

CONCLUSION
	In “Implement the expression trees using BST” we can see how to convert the arithmetic expression into infix, prefix, and postfix expression. As we saw in class diagrams the 
presentation of converting expressions. 

	From this project, we have learned to implement a few Java and Data Structures concepts in a future project such as creating node class, writing methods for infix, postfix, 
prefix expressions, when to use menu driven method. We also learned to create binary trees, stack diagrams for explaining the program.
